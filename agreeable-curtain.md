# agreeable curtain

- was the United States founded as a decentralized federation? "Checks and balances"
- what kind of bigram generator creates these workspace names?

In August 2017 I took a trip to Gillette, Wyoming. The purpose was threefold: the Total Solar Eclipse gave me a reason to go investigate a couple other things on my mind - Federal Firearms Licenses and the Coal Mining Industry. I'd been working on a data science project and found a numerical correlation between the two, but was hesitant to write anything up until I'd seen things firsthand. 

What brings this to mind: one morning on this trip I pulled up to McManamen Park in Gillette to photograph some birds. It's a great spot for birding, just at the edge of town and adjacent to a rifle/shotgun range. There were a few construction workers in the lot chatting, likely finishing up their morning. One was going on and on about he was dreading having to go home because he'd have to start on the project of hanging some curtains. I thought about how hot my Brooklyn space got every summer - because I didn't have any curtains. As I walked by, I mentioned how I also needed to hang some curtains once I got home. He replied heartily **_"Well don't look at me pal!"_**
