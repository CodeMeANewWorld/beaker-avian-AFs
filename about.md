# y 'AF'? üçµ

**_antifragile_** is a term coined by writer, philosopher, and former pit trader Nicholas Nassim Taleb to describe _"things that gain from disorder"_. By his definition, the _antifragile_ is distinct from the _robust_ in that the _robust_ maintains itself in the face of stressors, while the _antifragile_ emerges improved. 

If it were on a spectrum or dialectic: 

	fragile <--> robust <--> antifragile

The idea of antifragility became an interesting lens to try to understand why I was finding myself drawn to urban and exurban wildlife - specifically birds. As a practical matter, I began to name folders 'avian-AF' instead of writing out the word 'antifragile'. 

In addition to saving keystrokes, I didn't want to throw this odd or pretentious sounding word around too much. The [urban dictionary](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=AF) definition suits me just fine as well.
